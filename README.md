# Automated Wildlife Monitoring

## Introduction
This project focuses on developing an automated system for monitoring wildlife in their natural habitats, crucial for conservation strategies. Leveraging camera traps and advanced machine learning techniques, we aim to ease the workload on conservationists by accurately identifying a broad range of species across diverse environments. This initiative not only seeks to minimize costs and reduce human error but also to enhance the protection and tracking of species populations and changes.

## Datasets
We utilize three distinct datasets, encompassing a range of classes and image sizes to support our objective:
- **Dataset 1:** 19,000 images across 30 classes (1024x683 resolution)
- **Dataset 2:** 3,570 images across 75 classes (224x224 resolution)
- **Dataset 3:** 3,150 images across 50 classes (1200x1200 resolution)

These datasets provide a robust foundation for training our models, catering to the varying complexities and scales essential for the project's success.

## Methodologies
Our approach integrates three main architectures: VGG16, ResNet18, and GoogLeNet. Each is chosen for its unique advantages in processing and identifying features within our varied datasets. Through a combination of data preprocessing, feature extraction, and transfer learning, we aim to build models that are highly accurate and efficient in identifying wildlife.

## Milestones
The project is structured around four key milestones:
1. **Initiation and Research:** Formation of the team, project goals definition, and dataset acquisition.
2. **Data Preprocessing and Model Design:** Cleansing data and designing, training, and testing the models.
3. **Implementation of Transfer Learning Models:** Fine-tuning pre-trained models and ensuring code clarity and maintainability.
4. **Evaluation and Documentation:** Final analysis, comparison of model performances, and project documentation.
